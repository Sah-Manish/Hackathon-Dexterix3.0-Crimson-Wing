Hackathon Dexterix 3.0

Existing Problem:
		In today’s world of speed and efficiency, time is of great value and it is very clear society demand for software and API for doing their task automated and very fast and easy to handle. This is especially important while scheduling a meeting between the multiple party to find a gap in schedule, this simple yet complex task requires a lot of time and must care about convenient time also.

Proposed Solution:
So, to bridge this gap our Meeting Schedular will do this time-
consuming task and will return the result, which time slots are best for meeting. Our API will take data from their schedule as an array of time slots when they are busy and after complex mathematics it will give us time slots for timings for scheduling meeting.

Tools and Technology:
		Following technology and software are used for making API
•	A scripting Language
•	A GUI package/module for user friendly
•	File handling (if possible, Excel Sheet handling)

Result and Output:
		When this API is finished and working model has passed the testing phase it will revolutionise the way we schedule the meeting and this will not only save a lot of time but will also be able to schedule meeting considering 2 people but much more than that.

Conclusion and Future Scope:
		Now, we see google calendar and mark our schedule on it but we don’t have a feature of scheduling a meeting (to a person who schedules on same platform i.e., Google Calendar) after adding this API it will boost the productivity of such software and will enhance the comfort of the user.
